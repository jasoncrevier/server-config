# Server config
Docker compose files for services I like. They're designed to be modular. Start with with the base install and then install any other containers you like.

## Base install
Contains a compose file that sets up Nginx Proxy Manager and Portainer; a good starting point for server if you want to manage adding additional containers through a GUI.

## More to come
I'll be adding more compose files that will plug in to the base install.
