# Server config

Basic Ubuntu server setup guide and Docker compose files for services I like. Start with with the basic server setup, install the base install compose stack, and then install any other containers you like.

## Services

- Portainer + Nginx proxy manager (base install)
- Calibre-web
- Changedetection.io
- Libreddit
- Nextcloud
- Pihole
- Uptime Kuma
- Wg-easy (Wireguard GUI)
- Wordpress

## More to come

I'll be adding more compose files that plug in to the base install.

**Up next**:

- Watchtower
- Speed test
- Snapdrop
