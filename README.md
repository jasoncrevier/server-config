# My server config

This is a place for me to document and store my docker-compose and various other config files.

I make no guarantees that anything here is up-to-date or even working. But I'll do my best to keep it maintained. Hopefully you find it useful.

## How to use this repo

### :bulb: Get to know docker and compose

For this repo to be useful, you need to know the basics of [docker](https://www.docker.com/). In a nutshell, docker containers are applications that come bundled with everything they need to run. 

And also [docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/): "a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With Compose, you use a YAML file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration." 

All the applications in this repo are described in their own docker-compose.yml files.

### :rocket: Get your server set up

First, check out my [basic server setup](https://github.com/jasoncrevier/server-config/tree/main/basic%20server%20setup). If you're new to self-hosting, there's a few tips in there to help with performance and security.

Then, install the [base install](https://github.com/jasoncrevier/server-config/tree/main/base%20install) compose stack. It gives you 2 useful containers:

- Portainer -- A GUI for managing docker containers
- Nginx proxy manager -- A reverse proxy with a GUI and built in letsencrypt module for generating SSL certificates
